Hello! I'm Abdoulie, although most people call me Jallow. I have a bachelor's degree in biological chemistry and am deeply interested in science, epistemology, and lifelong learning. Some of my favorite thinkers include Karl Popper, David Deutsch, and Nick Lane. I created this website to document and share my learning journey. Feel free to explore and see what Iâ€™m working on!
