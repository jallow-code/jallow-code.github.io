Hello! I’m Abdoulie, but most people know me as Jallow. I hold a bachelor’s degree in biological chemistry and have a deep passion for science, epistemology, and lifelong learning. I admire thinkers like Karl Popper, David Deutsch, and Nick Lane. This website is my space to document and share my learning journey. Feel free to explore and see what I’m working on!
