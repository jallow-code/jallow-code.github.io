Hello! I’m Abdoulie—though most people call me by my last name, Jallow. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Biological Chemistry and am deeply fascinated by science, philosophy, and constantly learning new skills. I created this website to document and share my learning journey with others. Feel free to explore and see what I'm working on!
