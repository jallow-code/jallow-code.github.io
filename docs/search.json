    "section": "Exploratory Analysis and Preprocessing",
    "text": "Exploratory Analysis and Preprocessing\nExploratory analysis and preprocessing are essential steps in any data science project. They ensure that the dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for analysis. Some steps, such as identifying outliers or interpreting specific variables, may require domain knowledge. Reading the dataset documentation, if available, is always recommended as it provides valuable insights into the data’s structure.\nBelow are the key steps I followed for this dataset:\n\nImporting the Dataset\nThe first step is to load the dataset and assign appropriate column names to make the data easier to interpret.\n\n# Set the path to your extracted file\npath &lt;- \"dataset/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data\"\n\n# Read the data\ndata &lt;- read.table(path, sep = \",\")\n\n# Add column names\ncolnames(data) &lt;- c(\"Sample_code_number\", \"Clump_thickness\",\n                    \"Uniformity_of_cell_size\", \"Uniformity_of_cell_shape\",\n                    \"Marginal_adhesion\", \"Single_epithelial_cell_size\",\n                    \"Bare_nuclei\", \"Bland_chromatin\", \"Mitoses\",\n                    \"Normal_nucleoli\", \"Class\")\n\n# Check the updated dataset structure\nstr(data)\n\n'data.frame':   699 obs. of  11 variables:\n $ Sample_code_number         : int  1000025 1002945 1015425 1016277 1017023 1017122 1018099 1018561 1033078 1033078 ...\n $ Clump_thickness            : int  5 5 3 6 4 8 1 2 2 4 ...\n $ Uniformity_of_cell_size    : int  1 4 1 8 1 10 1 1 1 2 ...\n $ Uniformity_of_cell_shape   : int  1 4 1 8 1 10 1 2 1 1 ...\n $ Marginal_adhesion          : int  1 5 1 1 3 8 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Single_epithelial_cell_size: int  2 7 2 3 2 7 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Bare_nuclei                : chr  \"1\" \"10\" \"2\" \"4\" ...\n $ Bland_chromatin            : int  3 3 3 3 3 9 3 3 1 2 ...\n $ Mitoses                    : int  1 2 1 7 1 7 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Normal_nucleoli            : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 ...\n $ Class                      : int  2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2 ...\n\n\n\n\nMissing Values and Variable Encoding\nThis dataset uses \"?\" to represent missing values. These need to be replaced with NA for proper handling in R. We then remove rows containing missing values. Additionally, some variables are encoded incorrectly and need to be transformed into their appropriate data types.\n\n# Handle missing values and encode variables\ndata[data == \"?\"] &lt;- NA # Replace \"?\" with NA\ndata &lt;- na.omit(data)   # Remove rows with missing values\n\n# Drop uninformative column\ndata$Sample_code_number &lt;- NULL\n\n# Encode 'Class' as a factor with descriptive labels\ndata$Class &lt;- as.factor(ifelse(data$Class == 2, \"benign\", \"malignant\"))\n\n# Convert 'Bare_nuclei' to an integer\ndata$Bare_nuclei &lt;- as.integer(data$Bare_nuclei)\n\n\nstr(data)\n\n'data.frame':   683 obs. of  10 variables:\n $ Clump_thickness            : int  5 5 3 6 4 8 1 2 2 4 ...\n $ Uniformity_of_cell_size    : int  1 4 1 8 1 10 1 1 1 2 ...\n $ Uniformity_of_cell_shape   : int  1 4 1 8 1 10 1 2 1 1 ...\n $ Marginal_adhesion          : int  1 5 1 1 3 8 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Single_epithelial_cell_size: int  2 7 2 3 2 7 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Bare_nuclei                : int  1 10 2 4 1 10 10 1 1 1 ...\n $ Bland_chromatin            : int  3 3 3 3 3 9 3 3 1 2 ...\n $ Mitoses                    : int  1 2 1 7 1 7 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Normal_nucleoli            : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 ...\n $ Class                      : Factor w/ 2 levels \"benign\",\"malignant\": 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 ...\n - attr(*, \"na.action\")= 'omit' Named int [1:16] 24 41 140 146 159 165 236 250 276 293 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:16] \"24\" \"41\" \"140\" \"146\" ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nReading the dataset documentation is important for understanding how missing values and variables are encoded. For example, missing values in this dataset are not labeled as NA by default, and variables such as Bare_nuclei and Class needed to be converted to the appropriate data types (integer and factor, respectively).\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze the continuous variables\nTo identify redundant features, we analyze correlations among continuous variables. High collinearity can negatively impact model performance, so we address this by combining highly correlated features.\n\ndata_corr &lt;- cor(data[, -10]) \n\npairs.panels(data_corr, cex.labels = 0.6, ellipses = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variables Uniformity_of_cell_size and Uniformity_of_cell_shape are highly correlated. To reduce redundancy, we create a new variable, Cell_morphology, by randomly sampling values from these two columns row-wise.\n\n# Combine correlated variables into a single column\ndata$Cell_Morphology &lt;- apply(data[, c(\"Uniformity_of_cell_size\", \"Uniformity_of_cell_shape\")],\n                              MARGIN = 1, \n                              FUN = sample,\n                              size = 1)\n\n# Remove redundant variables\ndata$Uniformity_of_cell_size &lt;- NULL\ndata$Uniformity_of_cell_shape &lt;- NULL\n\n\nstr(data)\n\n'data.frame':   683 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ Clump_thickness            : int  5 5 3 6 4 8 1 2 2 4 ...\n $ Marginal_adhesion          : int  1 5 1 1 3 8 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Single_epithelial_cell_size: int  2 7 2 3 2 7 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Bare_nuclei                : int  1 10 2 4 1 10 10 1 1 1 ...\n $ Bland_chromatin            : int  3 3 3 3 3 9 3 3 1 2 ...\n $ Mitoses                    : int  1 2 1 7 1 7 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Normal_nucleoli            : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 ...\n $ Class                      : Factor w/ 2 levels \"benign\",\"malignant\": 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Cell_Morphology            : int  1 4 1 8 1 10 1 1 1 1 ...\n - attr(*, \"na.action\")= 'omit' Named int [1:16] 24 41 140 146 159 165 236 250 276 293 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:16] \"24\" \"41\" \"140\" \"146\" ...\n\n\n\n\nChecking for Class Imbalance\nClass imbalance is a common issue in classification tasks. Here, we analyze the distribution of the target variable (Class) to assess the extent of imbalance.\n\n# Count and calculate class percentages\ndata |&gt;\n  count(Class) |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = round((n / nrow(data)) * 100, 2))\n\n      Class   n Percentage\n1    benign 444      65.01\n2 malignant 239      34.99\n\n\nThe dataset shows a mildly imbalanced distribution, with the minority class representing approximately 35% of the data. This level of imbalance typically does not pose significant challenges, and models can often be trained directly on the original data. If the imbalance were severe, techniques such as upsampling or downsampling could be applied.\n\n\nSplitting the Dataset\nTo prepare for model training, we split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, allocating 70% of the data for training. We use cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation during model development.\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\ntrain &lt;- createDataPartition(data$Class, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)\n\n# Create training and testing subsets\ndata.trn &lt;- data[train, ]\ndata.tst &lt;- data[-train, ]\n\n\n# Define control parameters for model training\nctrl &lt;- trainControl(method = \"cv\",         # K-Fold cross-validation\n                     number = 10,           # 10 folds\n                     returnResamp = 'none',\n                     classProbs = TRUE,   \n                     savePredictions = TRUE,\n                     summaryFunction = twoClassSummary)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Statistical learning refers to a large collection of tools aimed at estimating the relationship between a set of predictors (\\(X = X_1, X_2, ..., X_p\\)) and a response (\\(Y\\)). This relationship can be expressed as \\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\), where \\(f\\) is some fixed but unknown function of \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_p\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) represents random error which is independent of \\(X\\) and has mean zero. These tools are generally classified into two categories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves estimating an output based on one or more inputs. In contrast, unsupervised learning involves inputs but no supervising outputs.\nSupervised learning has two primary purposes. The first objective is making predictions, where inputs (\\(X\\)) are readily available, but the output (\\(Y\\)) cannot be easily obtained. \\(Y\\) can be estimated using \\(\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)\\), where \\(\\hat{f}\\) is our estimate for the true function \\(f\\). In this setting, one is not typically concerned with the exact form of \\(\\hat{f}\\) as long as it yields accurate predictions for \\(Y\\). The second objective is making inferences, where we are interested in the association between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\). Hence, the exact form of \\(\\hat{f}\\) is very important. Key questions in inference include: which predictors are significantly associated with the response? What is the nature of the relationship between each predictor and the response? Can the relationship be adequately modeled by a linear equation, or is a more complex model necessary?\nMethods for estimating \\(f\\) are either parametric (assuming a specific form for \\(f\\), resulting in less flexible but more interpretable models) or non-parametric (making no assumptions about \\(f\\), leading to more flexible but less interpretable models). Problems with a quantitative response are often referred to as regression problems, while those involving a qualitative response are referred to as classification problems. In regression, model accuracy is assessed by minimizing test mean squared error (MSE), which involves balancing the bias and variance of the estimate. Generally, more flexible methods increase variance and decrease bias, and finding the optimal balance minimizes test MSE.\nIn classification, model performance is evaluated using the test error rate. The Bayes classifier, a theoretical benchmark, minimizes this rate by assigning observations to the class with the highest conditional probability. The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm provides a practical approach by estimating these probabilities based on the K nearest training points. The flexibility of KNN is controlled by the value of K: small K leads to high variance and low bias, while large K results in low variance and high bias. Balancing this trade-off is crucial to avoid overfitting (high variance) or underfitting (high bias).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.\n\nThe sample size \\(n\\) is extremely large, and the number of predictors \\(p\\) is small.\n\n\nA flexible method will be better because the model does not need to work hard to find patterns in the data hence reducing the likelihood of overfitting. Additionally, a flexible method in this situation will results in a lower test mean squared error (MSE), as the reduction in bias compensates for the increased variance.\n\n\nThe number of predictors \\(p\\) is extremely large, and the number of observations \\(n\\) is small.\n\n\nIn this situation an Inflexible method preferable because there is higher chance for the model to pickup patterns that may not exist in the test data.\n\n\nThe relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.\n\n\nA flexible method is preferred because an inflexible method will lead to high bias.\n\n\nThe variance of the error terms, i.e. \\(\\sigma^2 = Var(\\epsilon)\\), is extremely high.\n\n\nIn this case, an Inflexible method will perform better. With a flexible method, it may be difficult to differentiate the true pattern from the noise in the data. Flexible method have a higher variance because they fit more data.\n\n\n\n\nExplain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and indicate whether we are most interested in inference or prediction. Finally, provide \\(n\\) and \\(p\\).\n\nWe collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.\n\n\n\nsample size: 500\npredictors: profit, number of employees, and industry (3)\nregression problem because the response is quantitative\nWe are most interested in making inference.\n\n\n\nWe are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.\n\n\n\nsample size: 20\npredictors: 13\nclassification problem because the response is qualitative (success or failure)\nWe are interested in making predictions.\n\n\n\nWe are interested in predicting the % change in the USD/Euro exchange rate in relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012.

Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?\n\nInflexible methods are more interpretable and are generally preferred in cases with small \\(n\\) (sample size) and large \\(p\\) (number of predictors). However, they may suffer from high bias when the true underlying function is non-linear. Flexible methods, while capable of capturing non-linear patterns, are prone to overfitting, leading to high variance in error. In situations with a large \\(n\\) and small \\(p\\), flexible methods are preferred.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a non-parametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?\n\nParametric methods are more interpretable because they rely on a predefined model to generate the response. They also tend to perform better than non-parametric methods in high-dimensional settings, as they require estimating fewer parameters. However, a key disadvantage is that the model may not accurately reflect reality. If the assumed model is far from the true underlying relationship, the resulting estimates can be poor.\nIn contrast, non-parametric methods are highly flexible and can adapt to a wide range of underlying patterns. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: they require a larger number of observations to produce accurate estimates, as they do not rely on a small set of parameters and are more prone to overfitting when data is limited\n\n\n\n\nThe table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable.\n\n\n\nObs.\n\\(X_1\\)\n\\(X_2\\)\n\\(X_3\\)\n\\(Y\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n3\n0\nRed\n\n\n2\n2\n0\n0\nRed\n\n\n3\n0\n1\n3\nRed\n\n\n4\n0\n1\n2\nGreen\n\n\n5\n-1\n0\n1\nGreen\n\n\n6\n1\n1\n1\nRed\n\n\n\nSuppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for \\(Y\\) when \\(X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0\\) using \\(K\\)-nearest neighbors.\n\nCompute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, \\(X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0\\). \\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(X_{1_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2 + (X_{2_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2 + (X_{3_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n  Obs Distance     Y\n1   5 1.414214 Green\n2   6 1.732051   Red\n3   2 2.000000   Red\n4   4 2.236068 Green\n5   1 3.000000   Red\n6   3 3.162278   Red\n\n\n\nWhat is our prediction with \\(K = 1\\)?

Why?\n\nWhen \\(K = 3\\) our prediction will be Red because it is the majority (i.e, 2 Red and 1 Green).\n\nIf the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly non-linear, then would we expect the best value for \\(K\\) to be large or small? Why?\n\n\nIf the Bayes decision boundary is highly non-linear, a smaller \\(k\\) is better. This is because smaller \\(k\\) will capture the non-linear patterns in data. A large \\(k\\) may lead to underfiting since the true boundary is highly non-linear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(ISLR2) \n\n\n\nThis exercise relates to the College data set, which can be found in the file College.csv. It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are\n\nPrivate : Public/private indicator\nApps : Number of applications received\nAccept : Number of applicants accepted\nEnroll : Number of new students enrolled\nTop10perc : New students from top 10% of high school class\nTop25perc : New students from top 25% of high school class\nF.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates\nP.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates\nOutstate : Out-of-state tuition\nRoom.Board : Room and board costs\nBooks : Estimated book costs\nPersonal : Estimated personal spending\nPhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.’s\nTerminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree\nS.F.Ratio : Student/faculty ratio\nperc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate\nExpend : Instructional expenditure per student\nGrad.Rate : Graduation rate\n\nBefore reading the data into R, it can be viewed in Excel or a text editor.\n\nUse the read.csv() function to read the data into R. Call the loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.\n\n\ncollege &lt;- read.csv(\"College.csv\")\n\n\nLook at the data using the View() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. We don’t really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:\n\n\nrownames(college) &lt;- college[, 1]\nView(college)\n\nYou should see that there is now a row.names column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However, we still need to eliminate the first column in the data where the names are stored. Try\n\ncollege &lt;- college [, -1]\nView(college)\n\nNow you should see that the first data column is Private. Note that another column labeled row.names now appears before the Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather the name that R is giving to each row.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.\nUse the pairs() function to produce a scatter plot matrix of the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using A[,1:10].\nUse the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private.\nCreate a new qualitative variable, called Elite, by binning the Top10perc variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes exceeds 50%.\n\n\nElite &lt;- rep(\"No\", nrow(college))\nElite[college$Top10perc &gt; 50] &lt;- \"Yes\"\nElite &lt;- as.factor(Elite)\ncollege &lt;- data.frame(college, Elite)\n\nUse the summary() function to see how many elite universities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite.\n\nUse the hist() function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative variables. You may find the command par(mfrow=c(2,2)) useful: it will divide the print window into four regions so that four plots can be made simultaneously. Modifying the arguments to this function will divide the screen in other ways.\nContinue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.\n\n\n# First column(i.e, Private) is excluded since it is qualitative\npairs(college[, 2:11],\n      cex = 0.2,\n      col = 4,\n      cex.labels = 0.6,  # Size of diagonal texts\n      font.labels = 2)   # Font style of diagonal texts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschool_type &lt;- ifelse(college$Private == \"Yes\", \"Private\", \"Public\")\nschool_type &lt;- as.factor(school_type)\n\nplot(college$Outstate ~ factor(school_type),\n     col = \"white\",\n     xlab = \"\",\n     ylab = \"Outstate\")\n\nstripchart(college$Outstate ~ factor(school_type),\n           method = \"jitter\",\n           pch = 19,\n           col = 2:4,\n           vertical = TRUE,\n           add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\n\nbin_values &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 50)\nlapply(bin_values, function(n) {\n  hist(log10(college$Enroll), \n       breaks = n,\n       col = 4,\n       main = paste(\"Bins =\", n),\n       xlab = \"log(Enroll)\")\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis exercise involves the Auto data set studied in the lab.

    "text": "Statistical learning refers to a large collection of tools aimed at estimating the relationship between a set of predictors (\\(X = X_1, X_2, ..., X_p\\)) and a response (\\(Y\\)). This relationship can be expressed as \\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\), where \\(f\\) is some fixed but unknown function of \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_p\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) represents random error which is independent of \\(X\\) and has mean zero. These tools are generally classified into two categories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves estimating an output based on one or more inputs. In contrast, unsupervised learning involves inputs but no supervising outputs.\nSupervised learning has two primary purposes. The first objective is making predictions, where inputs (\\(X\\)) are readily available, but the output (\\(Y\\)) cannot be easily obtained. \\(Y\\) can be estimated using \\(\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)\\), where \\(\\hat{f}\\) is our estimate for the true function \\(f\\). In this setting, one is not typically concerned with the exact form of \\(\\hat{f}\\) as long as it yields accurate predictions for \\(Y\\). The second objective is making inferences, where we are interested in the association between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\). Hence, the exact form of \\(\\hat{f}\\) is very important. Key questions in inference include: which predictors are significantly associated with the response? What is the nature of the relationship between each predictor and the response? Can the relationship be adequately modeled by a linear equation, or is a more complex model necessary?\nMethods for estimating \\(f\\) are either parametric (assuming a specific form for \\(f\\), resulting in less flexible but more interpretable models) or non-parametric (making no assumptions about \\(f\\), leading to more flexible but less interpretable models). Problems with a quantitative response are often referred to as regression problems, while those involving a qualitative response are referred to as classification problems. In regression, model accuracy is assessed by minimizing test mean squared error (MSE), which involves balancing the bias and variance of the estimate. Generally, more flexible methods increase variance and decrease bias, and finding the optimal balance minimizes test MSE.\nIn classification, model performance is evaluated using the test error rate. The Bayes classifier, a theoretical benchmark, minimizes this rate by assigning observations to the class with the highest conditional probability. The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm provides a practical approach by estimating these probabilities based on the K nearest training points. The flexibility of KNN is controlled by the value of K: small K leads to high variance and low bias, while large K results in low variance and high bias. Balancing this trade-off is crucial to avoid overfitting (high variance) or underfitting (high bias)."

Justify your answer.\n\nThe sample size \\(n\\) is extremely large, and the number of predictors \\(p\\) is small.\n\n\nA flexible method will be better because the model does not need to work hard to find patterns in the data hence reducing the likelihood of overfitting. Additionally, a flexible method in this situation will results in a lower test mean squared error (MSE), as the reduction in bias compensates for the increased variance.\n\n\nThe number of predictors \\(p\\) is extremely large, and the number of observations \\(n\\) is small.\n\n\nIn this situation an Inflexible method preferable because there is higher chance for the model to pickup patterns that may not exist in the test data.\n\n\nThe relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.\n\n\nA flexible method is preferred because an inflexible method will lead to high bias.\n\n\nThe variance of the error terms, i.e. \\(\\sigma^2 = Var(\\epsilon)\\), is extremely high.\n\n\nIn this case, an Inflexible method will perform better.

Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?\n\nInflexible methods are more interpretable and are generally preferred in cases with small \\(n\\) (sample size) and large \\(p\\) (number of predictors). However, they may suffer from high bias when the true underlying function is non-linear. Flexible methods, while capable of capturing non-linear patterns, are prone to overfitting, leading to high variance in error. In situations with a large \\(n\\) and small \\(p\\), flexible methods are preferred.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a non-parametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?\n\nParametric methods are more interpretable because they rely on a predefined model to generate the response. They also tend to perform better than non-parametric methods in high-dimensional settings, as they require estimating fewer parameters. However, a key disadvantage is that the model may not accurately reflect reality. If the assumed model is far from the true underlying relationship, the resulting estimates can be poor.\nIn contrast, non-parametric methods are highly flexible and can adapt to a wide range of underlying patterns. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: they require a larger number of observations to produce accurate estimates, as they do not rely on a small set of parameters and are more prone to overfitting when data is limited\n\n\n\n\nThe table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable.\n\n\n\nObs.\n\\(X_1\\)\n\\(X_2\\)\n\\(X_3\\)\n\\(Y\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n3\n0\nRed\n\n\n2\n2\n0\n0\nRed\n\n\n3\n0\n1\n3\nRed\n\n\n4\n0\n1\n2\nGreen\n\n\n5\n-1\n0\n1\nGreen\n\n\n6\n1\n1\n1\nRed\n\n\n\nSuppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for \\(Y\\) when \\(X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0\\) using \\(K\\)-nearest neighbors.\n\nCompute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, \\(X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0\\). \\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(X_{1_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2 + (X_{2_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2 + (X_{3_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n  Obs Distance     Y\n1   5 1.414214 Green\n2   6 1.732051   Red\n3   2 2.000000   Red\n4   4 2.236068 Green\n5   1 3.000000   Red\n6   3 3.162278   Red\n\n\n\nWhat is our prediction with \\(K = 1\\)?

Why?\n\nWhen \\(K = 3\\) our prediction will be Red because it is the majority (i.e, 2 Red and 1 Green).\n\nIf the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly non-linear, then would we expect the best value for \\(K\\) to be large or small? Why?\n\n\nIf the Bayes decision boundary is highly non-linear, a smaller \\(k\\) is better. This is because smaller \\(k\\) will capture the non-linear patterns in data. A large \\(k\\) may lead to underfiting since the true boundary is highly non-linear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(ISLR2) \n\n\n\nThis exercise relates to the College data set, which can be found in the file College.csv. It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are\n\nPrivate : Public/private indicator\nApps : Number of applications received\nAccept : Number of applicants accepted\nEnroll : Number of new students enrolled\nTop10perc : New students from top 10% of high school class\nTop25perc : New students from top 25% of high school class\nF.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates\nP.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates\nOutstate : Out-of-state tuition\nRoom.Board : Room and board costs\nBooks : Estimated book costs\nPersonal : Estimated personal spending\nPhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.’s\nTerminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree\nS.F.Ratio : Student/faculty ratio\nperc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate\nExpend : Instructional expenditure per student\nGrad.Rate : Graduation rate\n\nBefore reading the data into R, it can be viewed in Excel or a text editor.\n\nUse the read.csv() function to read the data into R. Call the loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.\n\n\ncollege &lt;- read.csv(\"College.csv\")\n\n\nLook at the data using the View() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. We don’t really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:\n\n\nrownames(college) &lt;- college[, 1]\nView(college)\n\nYou should see that there is now a row.names column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However, we still need to eliminate the first column in the data where the names are stored. Try\n\ncollege &lt;- college [, -1]\nView(college)\n\nNow you should see that the first data column is Private. Note that another column labeled row.names now appears before the Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather the name that R is giving to each row.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.\nUse the pairs() function to produce a scatter plot matrix of the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using A[,1:10].\nUse the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private.\nCreate a new qualitative variable, called Elite, by binning the Top10perc variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes exceeds 50%.\n\n\nElite &lt;- rep(\"No\", nrow(college))\nElite[college$Top10perc &gt; 50] &lt;- \"Yes\"\nElite &lt;- as.factor(Elite)\ncollege &lt;- data.frame(college, Elite)\n\nUse the summary() function to see how many elite universities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite.\n\nUse the hist() function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative variables. You may find the command par(mfrow=c(2,2)) useful: it will divide the print window into four regions so that four plots can be made simultaneously. Modifying the arguments to this function will divide the screen in other ways.\nContinue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.\n\n\n# First column(i.e, Private) is excluded since it is qualitative\npairs(college[, 2:11],\n      cex = 0.2,\n      col = 4,\n      cex.labels = 0.6,  # Size of diagonal texts\n      font.labels = 2)   # Font style of diagonal texts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschool_type &lt;- ifelse(college$Private == \"Yes\", \"Private\", \"Public\")\nschool_type &lt;- as.factor(school_type)\n\nplot(college$Outstate ~ factor(school_type),\n     col = \"white\",\n     xlab = \"\",\n     ylab = \"Outstate\")\n\nstripchart(college$Outstate ~ factor(school_type),\n           method = \"jitter\",\n           pch = 19,\n           col = 2:4,\n           vertical = TRUE,\n           add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\n\nbin_values &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 50)\nlapply(bin_values, function(n) {\n  hist(log10(college$Enroll), \n       breaks = n,\n       col = 4,\n       main = paste(\"Bins =\", n),\n       xlab = \"log(Enroll)\")\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis exercise involves the Auto data set studied in the lab.

Prove that this is the case. In other words, under the assumption that the observations in the kth class are drawn from a N(µk,σ2) distribution, the Bayes classifier assigns an observation to the class for which the discriminant function is maximized.\n\n\\[\np_k(x) = \\frac{\\pi_k\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma}} \\cdot \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x - \\mu_k)^2)}\n              {\\sum_{l=1}^k \\pi_l\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma}} \\cdot \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x - \\mu_l)^2)}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nThe discriminant function is\n\\[\n\\delta_k(x) = x.\\frac{\\mu_k}{\\sigma^2} - \\frac{\\mu_k^2}{2\\sigma_2} + \\log(\\pi_k)\n\\tag{4}\\]\nTo show Equation 3 is equals to Equation 4, we first assume \\(\\sigma_1^2\\;=\\;...\\;=\\sigma_k^2\\).

On the test set?\n\n\nQDA been the more flexible model will perform better on the training set, but worse on the test set. On the test set, QDA will overfit the data because the true decision boundary is linear.\n\n\nIf the Bayes decision boundary is non-linear, do we expect LDA or QDA to perform better on the training set? On the test set?\n\n\nIn this situation since the decision boundary is non-linear, QDA will perform better in both data sets. A linear model will underfit in this case.\n\n\nIn general, as the sample size \\(n\\) increases, do we expect the test prediction accuracy of QDA relative to LDA to improve, decline, or be unchanged? Why?\n\n\nAs sample size increase, QDA will improve because there is more data to fit and the low bias will offset increase in variance.\n\n\nTrue or False: Even if the Bayes decision boundary for a given problem is linear, we will probably achieve a superior test error rate using QDA rather than LDA because QDA is flexible enough to model a linear decision boundary. Justify your answer.\n\n\nFalse. In this case, QDA will overfit the data.\n\n\nSuppose we collect data for a group of students in a statistics class with variables \\(X_1 =\\) hours studied, \\(X_2 =\\) undergrad GPA, and \\(Y =\\) receive an A. We fit a logistic regression and produce estimated coefficient, \\(\\hat\\beta_0 = -6\\), \\(\\hat\\beta_1 = 0.05\\), \\(\\hat\\beta_2 = 1\\).\n\n(a). Estimate the probability that a student who studies for 40h and has an undergrad GPA of 3.5 gets an A in the class.\n\\[\np(X) = \\frac{e^{-6 + 0.05X_1 + X_2}}{1 + e^{-6 + 0.05X_1 + X_2}}\n\\]\nwhen \\(X_1 = 40\\) and \\(X_2 = 3.5\\), \\(p(X) = 0.38\\)\n\nHow many hours would the student in part (a) need to study to have a 50% chance of getting an A in the class?\n\n\\[\\begin{gather}\n\n\\log\\left(\\frac{p(X)}{1-p(x)}\\right) = -6 + 0.05X_1 + X_2 \\\\\n\n\\log\\left(\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}\\right) = -6 + 0.05X_1 + 3.5 \\\\\n\n\\end{gather}\\]\nTherefore, solving the equation \\(0 = −6 + 0.05X_1 + 3.5\\), \\(X_1 = 50\\) hours.\n\nSuppose that we wish to predict whether a given stock will issue a dividend this year (“Yes” or “No”) based on \\(X\\), last year’s percent profit. We examine a large number of companies and discover that the mean value of \\(X\\) for companies that issued a dividend was \\(\\bar{X} = 10\\), while the mean for those that didn’t was \\(\\bar{X} = 0\\). In addition, the variance of \\(X\\) for these two sets of companies was \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 36\\). Finally, 80% of companies issued dividends. Assuming that \\(X\\) follows a normal distribution, predict the probability that a company will issue a dividend this year given that its percentage profit was \\(X = 4\\) last year.\n\nHint: Recall that the density function for a normal random variable is \\(f(x) =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/2\\sigma^2}\\). You will need to use Bayes’ theorem.\nValue of companies issuing a dividend (D) = \\(D \\sim \\mathcal{N}(10, 36)\\).\nValue \\(v\\) for companies not issuing a dividend \\((D^c)\\) = \\(D^c \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 36)\\) and \\(p(D) = 0.8\\).\nBayes theorem:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(D|X) &= \\frac{P(D) \\cdot{} P(X|D)}{P(D) \\cdot{} P(X|D) + P(D^c) \\cdot{} P(X|D^c)} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstitute the Gaussian likelihoods into Bayes theorem\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(D|X) &= \\frac{P(D) \\cdot{} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-(x-\\mu_D)^2/2\\sigma^2}}\n               {P(D) \\cdot{} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-(x-\\mu_D)^2/2\\sigma^2} +\n                P(D^c) \\cdot{} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-(x-\\mu_{D^c})^2/2\\sigma^2}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nFactor out \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\) from the numerator and denominator, which cancels out:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(D|X)  &= \\frac{P(D) \\cdot{} e^{-(x-\\mu_D)^2/2\\sigma^2}}\n               {P(D) \\cdot{} e^{-(x-\\mu_D)^2/2\\sigma^2} +\n                P(D^c) \\cdot{} e^{-(x-\\mu_{D^c})^2/2\\sigma^2}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstitute the given probabilities and means:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(D|X)  &= \\frac{0.8 \\times e^{-(4-10)^2/(2 \\times 36)}}\n               {0.8 \\times e^{-(4-10)^2/(2 \\times 36)} + 0.2 \\times e^{-(4-0)^2/(2 \\times 36)}} \\\\\n       &= \\frac{0.8 \\cdot e^{-1/2}}{0.8 \\cdot e^{-1/2} + 0.2 \\cdot e^{-2/9}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nexp(-0.5) * 0.8 / (exp(-0.5) * 0.8 + exp(-2/9) * 0.2)\n\n[1] 0.7518525\n\n\n\nSuppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures. First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20% on the training data and 30% on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. \\(K = 1\\)) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations? Why?\n\n\nLogistic regression will perform better because it has a lower test error rate. For \\(K = 1\\), the training error rate is always zero because the closest point is always the training point itself, so the model will never make a mistake on the training set. Given that the average error rate for 1-NN is 18%, this implies a test error rate of 36%. Logistic regression, with a test error rate of 30%, is therefore the better choice.\n\n\nThis problem has to do with odds.\n\n\n\nOn average, what fraction of people with an odds of 0.37 of defaulting on their credit card payment will in fact default?\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p(x)}{1 - P(x)} = odd\\\\\n\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\np(x) = \\frac{odd}{1 + odd}\\\\\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\np(x)  = \\frac{0.37}{1 + 0.37} = 0.27\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nSuppose that an individual has a 16% chance of defaulting on her credit card payment. What are the odds that she will default?\n\n\\[0.16 / (1 - 0.16)  = 0.19\\]\n\nTo Do\nTo Do\nSuppose that you wish to classify an observation \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) into apples and oranges. You fit a logistic regression model and find that\n\n\\[\n\\hat{Pr}(Y=orange|X=x) =\n\\frac{\\exp(\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1x)}{1 + \\exp(\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1x)}\n\\]\nYour friend fits a logistic regression model to the same data using the softmax formulation in (4.13), and finds that\n\\[\n\\hat{Pr}(Y=orange|X=x) =\n\\frac{\\exp(\\hat\\alpha_{orange0} + \\hat\\alpha_{orange1}x)}\n{\\exp(\\hat\\alpha_{orange0} + \\hat\\alpha_{orange1}x) + \\exp(\\hat\\alpha_{apple0} + \\hat\\alpha_{apple1}x)}\n\\]\n\nWhat is the log odds of orange versus apple in your model?\n\n\nThe log odds (\\(\\frac{p(x)}{1 - P(x)}\\)) in my model will be \\(\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1x\\)\n\n\nWhat is the log odds of orange versus apple in your friend’s model?\n\nLog odds of our friend model:\n\\[\n(\\hat\\alpha_{orange0} - \\hat\\alpha_{apple0}) + (\\hat\\alpha_{orange1} - \\hat\\alpha_{apple1})x\n\\]\n\nSuppose that in your model, \\(\\hat\\beta_0 = 2\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta = −1\\). What are the coefficient estimates in your friend’s model? Be as specific as possible.\n\nThe coefficient estimate in my friend’s model:\n\n\\(\\hat\\alpha_{orange0} -\\hat\\alpha_{apple0} = 2\\)\n\\(\\hat\\alpha_{orange1} - \\hat\\alpha_{apple1} = -1\\).\n\n\nNow suppose that you and your friend fit the same two models on a different data set. This time, your friend gets the coefficient estimates \\(\\hat\\alpha_{orange0} = 1.2\\), \\(\\hat\\alpha_{orange1} = −2\\), \\(\\hat\\alpha_{apple0} = 3\\), \\(\\hat\\alpha_{apple1} = 0.6\\). What are the coefficient estimates in your model?\n\nThe coefficients in my model would be \\(\\hat\\beta_0 = 1.2 - 3 = -1.8\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_1 = -2 - 0.6 = -2.6\\)\n\nFinally, suppose you apply both models from (d) to a data set with 2,000 test observations. What fraction of the time do you expect the predicted class labels from your model to agree with those from your friend’s model? Explain your answer.\n\nThey should agree everytime (i.e, pridictions and log odd between any pair of classes will remain the same, regardless of coding). The cofficient will be different because of the choice of baseline.\n\n\nApplied\n\nThis question should be answered using the Weekly data set, which is part of the ISLR2 package.
