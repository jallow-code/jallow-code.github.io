I further modified the Quarto template to fulfill JKU's formal criteria for diploma theses. Using Quarto was motivated by the difficulties I had when writing my first bachelor thesis in Microsoft Word. The main difficulties were ensuring consistent citation formatting, text alignment, and maintaining a tidy version-controlled workflow. Quarto effectively addresses these challenges. Above all, it combines data analysis and documentation into one platform thereby improving reproducibility.\n\n# Installing the Template\n\nThe GitHub repository for the Quarto thesis template can be found [here](https://github.com/jallow-code/jku-quarto-thesis). Follow these steps to install and use the template:\n\n## 1. Clone the Template\n\nNavigate to the directory where you want to create your thesis files. Run the following command in a terminal to download the template and its associated folders:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nquarto use template jallow-code/jku-quarto-thesis\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to specify an empty directory name for the template files. Provide a name for the new directory, which will store your thesis files.\n\n## 2. Render the Template\n\nOnce the template is installed, change into the new directory:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd <new-directory-name>\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nTo generate the document, use the command:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nquarto render\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Errors\n\nIf you encounter the following error during rendering:\n\n``` vbnet\n\nERROR: \ncompilation failed - missing packages (automatic install disabled)\nLaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \\item.\n\nSee the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.\nType  H <return>  for immediate help.\n ...\nl.872 \\end{CSLReferences}\n```\n\nThis error is likely due to outdated versions of Quarto or TinyTeX. To resolve it:\n\n-   Update your [TinyTex installation](https://yihui.org/tinytex/).\n\n-   Ensure you are using the latest version of Quarto.\n\n# Using the Template with an Existing Document\n\nTo use this template with an existing Quarto project, make sure you have all the required LaTeX folders as described above. Then, run:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nquarto install extension jallow-code/jku-quarto-thesis\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Basic Usage and Customization\n\n## Thesis Type and Frontmatter\n\nThe template is configured for a Bachelor’s thesis by default. To change this, edit the `_quarto.yml` file. For example:\n\n``` yaml\n\nthesis:\n  type: Bachelor Thesis # Or \"Master Thesis\", \"Doctoral Dissertation\", etc.\n  degree-name: Bachelor of Science\n  group: Biological Chemistry # name of your study program\n  supervisor:\n    primary: \"Assoz. Univ.-Prof. Dr. Ian Teasdale\"\n    co: \"Dipl.-Ing. Michael Kneidinger\"\n  university: Johannes Kepler Universität Linz\n  department: Institute of Polymer Chemistry\n  faculty: Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences\n```\n\nYou can also customize elements of the front matter (e.g., acknowledgments, dedication) by commenting out or modifying the respective sections in`_quarto.yml`. For instance, to exclude the dedication page:\n\n``` yaml\n\n# dedication: \"Frontmatter/dedication.tex\"\n```\n\n## Adding Symbols or Abbreviations\n\nThe `Frontmatter` folder contains LaTeX files for abbreviations, symbols, and other sections. If needed, search online for LaTeX code examples to add symbols or format abbreviations.\n\n# Citation Styling\n\nThe default citation style is `nature-chemistry.csl`. If you prefer another style, download it from the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles?fields=chemistry) and update the `_quarto.yml` file:\n\n``` yml\n\nbibliography: [example.bib]\ncsl: your-preferred-style.csl\n```\n\n# Additional Resources\n\n-   For detailed usage instructions, refer to the rendered sample PDF file below.\n\n-   Explore the [Quarto technical writing documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html), especially if you are new to Quarto.\n\n-   Watch Eli Holmes's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@eeholmes-datascience4849) for insights into data science workflows and Quarto.\n\n# Sample Document\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.embed-container {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 129%;\n    height: 0;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.embed-container iframe,\n.embed-container object,\n.embed-container embed {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n</style>\n:::\n\n```{=html}\n<p class=\"text-center\">\n  <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg doc-download\" href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down\"></i>&ensp;Download thesis sample\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"thesis_template.pdf\" style=\"border: 0.5px\"></iframe>\n</div>\n```\n",
