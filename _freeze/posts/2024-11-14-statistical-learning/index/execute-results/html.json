This relationship can be expressed as $Y = f(X) + \\epsilon$, where $f$ is some fixed but unknown function of $X_1, X_2, ..., X_p$ and $\\epsilon$ represents random error which is independent of $X$ and has mean zero. These tools are generally classified into two categories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves estimating an output based on one or more inputs. In contrast, unsupervised learning involves inputs but no supervising outputs.\n\nSupervised learning has two primary purposes. The first objective is making predictions, where inputs ($X$) are readily available, but the output ($Y$) cannot be easily obtained. $Y$ can be estimated using $\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)$, where $\\hat{f}$ is our estimate for the true function $f$. In this setting, one is not typically concerned with the exact form of $\\hat{f}$ as long as it yields accurate predictions for $Y$. The second objective is making inferences, where we are interested in the association between $Y$ and $X$. Hence, the exact form of $\\hat{f}$ is very important. Key questions in inference include: which predictors are significantly associated with the response? What is the nature of the relationship between each predictor and the response? Can the relationship be adequately modeled by a linear equation, or is a more complex model necessary?\n\nMethods for estimating $f$ are either parametric (assuming a specific form for $f$, resulting in less flexible but more interpretable models) or non-parametric (making no assumptions about $f$, leading to more flexible but less interpretable models). Problems with a quantitative response are often referred to as regression problems, while those involving a qualitative response are referred to as classification problems. In regression, model accuracy is assessed by minimizing test mean squared error (MSE), which involves balancing the bias and variance of the estimate. Generally, more flexible methods increase variance and decrease bias, and finding the optimal balance minimizes test MSE.\n\nIn classification, model performance is evaluated using the test error rate. The Bayes classifier, a theoretical benchmark, minimizes this rate by assigning observations to the class with the highest conditional probability. The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm provides a practical approach by estimating these probabilities based on the K nearest training points. The flexibility of KNN is controlled by the value of K: small K leads to high variance and low bias, while large K results in low variance and high bias. Balancing this trade-off is crucial to avoid overfitting (high variance) or underfitting (high bias).\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Conceptual\n\n#### Question 1\n\nFor each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.\n\na.  The sample size $n$ is extremely large, and the number of predictors $p$ is small.\n\n> A flexible method will be better because the model does not need to work hard to find patterns in the data hence reducing the likelihood of overfitting. Additionally, a flexible method in this situation will results in a lower test mean squared error (MSE), as the reduction in bias compensates for the increased variance.\n\nb.  The number of predictors $p$ is extremely large, and the number of observations $n$ is small.\n\n> In this situation an Inflexible method preferable because there is higher chance for the model to pickup patterns that may not exist in the test data.\n\nc.  The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.\n\n> A flexible method is preferred because an inflexible method will lead to high bias.\n\nd.  The variance of the error terms, i.e. $\\sigma^2 = Var(\\epsilon)$, is extremely high.\n\n> In this case, an Inflexible method will perform better. With a flexible method, it may be difficult to differentiate the true pattern from the noise in the data. Flexible method have a higher variance because they fit more data.\n\n#### Question 2\n\nExplain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and indicate whether we are most interested in inference or prediction. Finally, provide $n$ and $p$.\n\na.  We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.\n\n> -   sample size: 500\n> -   predictors: profit, number of employees, and industry (3)\n> -   regression problem because the response is quantitative\n> -   We are most interested in making inference.\n\nb.  We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.\n\n> -   sample size: 20\n> -   predictors: 13\n> -   classification problem because the response is qualitative (success or failure)\n> -   We are interested in making predictions.\n\nc.  We are interested in predicting the % change in the USD/Euro exchange rate in relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For each week we record the % change in the USD/Euro, the % change in the US market, the % change in the British market, and the % change in the German market.\n\n> -   sample size: 52\n> -   predictors: 3\n> -   regression problem because the response is quantitative\n> -   We are interested in making prediction.\n\n#### Question 3\n\nWe now revisit the bias-variance decomposition.\n\na.  Provide a sketch of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error, test error, and Bayes (or irreducible) error curves, on a single plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible approaches. The x-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the y-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five curves. Make sure to label each one.\n\nb.  Explain why each of the five curves has the shape displayed in part (a).\n\n> -   Squared Bias: Decreases as model flexibility increases since more flexible methods are better at capturing complex patterns in the data.\n> -   Variance: Increases with greater flexibility, as flexible models are more sensitive to variations in the training data.\n> -   Training Error: Decreases with increasing flexibility because more complex models can closely fit the training data.\n> -   Test Error: Initially decreases with flexibility due to reduced bias but eventually increases as overfitting leads to higher variance.\n> -   Bayes Error: Remains constant, as it is independent of the model's complexity and reflects the inherent noise in the data.\n\n#### Question 4\n\nYou will now think of some real-life applications for statistical learning.\n\na.  Describe three real-life applications in which classification might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your answer.\n\n> Email Classification (Spam or Not Spam):\n>\n> -   Variables ($p$): Certain keywords, email structure, sender information\n>\n> -   Aim: Prediction\n>\n> Factors Associated with Winning an Election:\n>\n> -   Variables ($p$): Campaign budget, market trends, poll results, etc.\n>\n> -   Aim: Inference\n>\n> Food Spoilage (Healthy or Not Healthy for Consumption)\n>\n> -   Variables ($p$): Color, texture, smell, etc.\n>\n> -   Aim: Prediction\n\nb.  Describe three real-life applications in which regression might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your answer.\n\n> Analyzing the Effect of Marketing Budget on Sales Response: Total revenue\n>\n> -   Variables ($p$): Marketing budget allocated to different channels (e.g., social media, TV ads, print media), time of year, and product price.\n>\n> -   Aim: Inference\n>\n> Predicting Housing Prices Response Variable: Sale price of a house.\n>\n> -   Predictors: Square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location etc\n>\n> -   Aim: Prediction\n\nc.  Describe three real-life applications in which cluster analysis might be useful.\n\n> -   Genomic data analysis for example RNA seq.\n> -   finding categories in illnesses, cells, or organisms\n\n#### Question 5\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus a less flexible) approach for regression or classification? Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?\n\n> Inflexible methods are more interpretable and are generally preferred in cases with small $n$ (sample size) and large $p$ (number of predictors). However, they may suffer from high bias when the true underlying function is non-linear. Flexible methods, while capable of capturing non-linear patterns, are prone to overfitting, leading to high variance in error. In situations with a large $n$ and small $p$, flexible methods are preferred.\n\n#### Question 6\n\nDescribe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a non-parametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?\n\n> Parametric methods are more interpretable because they rely on a predefined model to generate the response. They also tend to perform better than non-parametric methods in high-dimensional settings, as they require estimating fewer parameters. However, a key disadvantage is that the model may not accurately reflect reality. If the assumed model is far from the true underlying relationship, the resulting estimates can be poor.\n>\n> In contrast, non-parametric methods are highly flexible and can adapt to a wide range of underlying patterns. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: they require a larger number of observations to produce accurate estimates, as they do not rely on a small set of parameters and are more prone to overfitting when data is limited\n\n#### Question 7\n\nThe table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable.\n\n| Obs. | $X_1$ | $X_2$ | $X_3$ | $Y$   |\n|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| 1    | 0     | 3     | 0     | Red   |\n| 2    | 2     | 0     | 0     | Red   |\n| 3    | 0     | 1     | 3     | Red   |\n| 4    | 0     | 1     | 2     | Green |\n| 5    | -1    | 0     | 1     | Green |\n| 6    | 1     | 1     | 1     | Red   |\n\nSuppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for $Y$ when $X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0$ using $K$-nearest neighbors.\n\na.  Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, $X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = 0$. $$\n    \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(X_{1_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2 + (X_{2_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2 + (X_{3_{\\text{obs}}} - 0)^2}\n    $$\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Obs Distance     Y\n1   5 1.414214 Green\n2   6 1.732051   Red\n3   2 2.000000   Red\n4   4 2.236068 Green\n5   1 3.000000   Red\n6   3 3.162278   Red\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nb.  What is our prediction with $K = 1$? Why?\n\n    > Our prediction will be `Green` because it have the smallest distance (obs. 5)\n\nc.  What is our prediction with $K = 3$? Why?\n\n    > When $K = 3$ our prediction will be `Red` because it is the majority (i.e, 2 Red and 1 Green).\n\nd.  If the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly non-linear, then would we expect the best value for $K$ to be large or small? Why?\n\n> If the Bayes decision boundary is highly non-linear, a smaller $k$ is better. This is because smaller $k$ will capture the non-linear patterns in data. A large $k$ may lead to underfiting since the true boundary is highly non-linear.\n\n### Applied\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(ISLR2) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Question 8\n\nThis exercise relates to the `College` data set, which can be found in the file `College.csv`. It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are\n\n-   `Private` : Public/private indicator\n-   `Apps` : Number of applications received\n-   `Accept` : Number of applicants accepted\n-   `Enroll` : Number of new students enrolled\n-   `Top10perc` : New students from top 10% of high school class\n-   `Top25perc` : New students from top 25% of high school class\n-   `F.Undergrad` : Number of full-time undergraduates\n-   `P.Undergrad` : Number of part-time undergraduates\n-   `Outstate` : Out-of-state tuition\n-   `Room.Board` : Room and board costs\n-   `Books` : Estimated book costs\n-   `Personal` : Estimated personal spending\n-   `PhD` : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.'s\n-   `Terminal` : Percent of faculty with terminal degree\n-   `S.F.Ratio` : Student/faculty ratio\n-   `perc.alumni` : Percent of alumni who donate\n-   `Expend` : Instructional expenditure per student\n-   `Grad.Rate` : Graduation rate\n\nBefore reading the data into `R`, it can be viewed in Excel or a text editor.\n\na.  Use the `read.csv()` function to read the data into `R`. Call the loaded data `college`. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege <- read.csv(\"College.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nb.  Look at the data using the `View()` function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. We don't really want `R` to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrownames(college) <- college[, 1]\nView(college)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou should see that there is now a `row.names` column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. `R` will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However, we still need to eliminate the first column in the data where the names are stored. Try\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege <- college [, -1]\nView(college)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow you should see that the first data column is `Private`. Note that another column labeled `row.names` now appears before the `Private` column. However, this is not a data column but rather the name that R is giving to each row.\n\nc.  \n\ni.  Use the `summary()` function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.\n\nii. Use the `pairs()` function to produce a scatter plot matrix of the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using `A[,1:10]`.\n\niii. Use the `plot()` function to produce side-by-side boxplots of `Outstate` versus `Private`.\n\niv. Create a new qualitative variable, called `Elite`, by *binning* the `Top10perc` variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes exceeds 50%.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nElite <- rep(\"No\", nrow(college))\nElite[college$Top10perc > 50] <- \"Yes\"\nElite <- as.factor(Elite)\ncollege <- data.frame(college, Elite)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nUse the `summary()` function to see how many elite universities there are. Now use the `plot()` function to produce side-by-side boxplots of `Outstate` versus `Elite`.\n\nv.  Use the `hist()` function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative variables. You may find the command `par(mfrow=c(2,2))` useful: it will divide the print window into four regions so that four plots can be made simultaneously. Modifying the arguments to this function will divide the screen in other ways.\n\nw.  Continue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# First column(i.e, Private) is excluded since it is qualitative\npairs(college[, 2:11],\n      cex = 0.2,\n      col = 4,\n      cex.labels = 0.6,  # Size of diagonal texts\n      font.labels = 2)   # Font style of diagonal texts\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nschool_type <- ifelse(college$Private == \"Yes\", \"Private\", \"Public\")\nschool_type <- as.factor(school_type)\n\nplot(college$Outstate ~ factor(school_type),\n     col = \"white\",\n     xlab = \"\",\n     ylab = \"Outstate\")\n\nstripchart(college$Outstate ~ factor(school_type),\n           method = \"jitter\",\n           pch = 19,\n           col = 2:4,\n           vertical = TRUE,\n           add = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\n\nbin_values <- c(10, 20, 30, 50)\nlapply(bin_values, function(n) {\n  hist(log10(college$Enroll), \n       breaks = n,\n       col = 4,\n       main = paste(\"Bins =\", n),\n       xlab = \"log(Enroll)\")\n})\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Question 9\n\nThis exercise involves the Auto data set studied in the lab.

It was stated in the text that classifying an observation to the class for which (4.17) is largest is equivalent to classifying an observation to the class for which (4.18) is largest. Prove that this is the case.

If the Bayes decision boundary is non-linear, do we expect LDA or QDA to perform better on the training set?

Why?\n\n> As sample size increase, QDA will improve because there is more data to fit and the low bias will offset increase in variance.\n\nd.

Suppose we collect data for a group of students in a statistics class with variables $X_1 =$ hours studied, $X_2 =$ undergrad GPA, and $Y =$ receive an A.

Suppose that we wish to predict whether a given stock will issue a dividend this year (\"Yes\" or \"No\") based on $X$, last year's percent profit. We examine a large number of companies and discover that the mean value of $X$ for companies that issued a dividend was $\\bar{X} = 10$, while the mean for those that didn't was $\\bar{X} = 0$. In addition, the variance of $X$ for these two sets of companies was $\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 36$. Finally, 80% of companies issued dividends. Assuming that $X$ follows a normal distribution, predict the probability that a company will issue a dividend this year given that its percentage profit was $X = 4$ last year.\n\n*Hint: Recall that the density function for a normal random variable is* $f(x) =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/2\\sigma^2}$. *You will need to use Bayes' theorem.*\n\nValue of companies issuing a dividend (D) = $D \\sim \\mathcal{N}(10, 36)$.\n\nValue $v$ for companies not issuing a dividend $(D^c)$ = $D^c \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 36)$ and $p(D) = 0.8$.\n\nBayes theorem:\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(D|X) &= \\frac{P(D) \\cdot{} P(X|D)}{P(D) \\cdot{} P(X|D) + P(D^c) \\cdot{} P(X|D^c)} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nSubstitute the Gaussian likelihoods into Bayes theorem\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(D|X) &= \\frac{P(D) \\cdot{} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-(x-\\mu_D)^2/2\\sigma^2}}\n               {P(D) \\cdot{} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-(x-\\mu_D)^2/2\\sigma^2} +\n                P(D^c) \\cdot{} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-(x-\\mu_{D^c})^2/2\\sigma^2}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nFactor out $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}$ from the numerator and denominator, which cancels out:\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(D|X)  &= \\frac{P(D) \\cdot{} e^{-(x-\\mu_D)^2/2\\sigma^2}}\n               {P(D) \\cdot{} e^{-(x-\\mu_D)^2/2\\sigma^2} +\n                P(D^c) \\cdot{} e^{-(x-\\mu_{D^c})^2/2\\sigma^2}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nSubstitute the given probabilities and means:\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(D|X)  &= \\frac{0.8 \\times e^{-(4-10)^2/(2 \\times 36)}}\n               {0.8 \\times e^{-(4-10)^2/(2 \\times 36)} + 0.2 \\times e^{-(4-0)^2/(2 \\times 36)}} \\\\\n       &= \\frac{0.8 \\cdot e^{-1/2}}{0.8 \\cdot e^{-1/2} + 0.2 \\cdot e^{-2/9}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp(-0.5) * 0.8 / (exp(-0.5) * 0.8 + exp(-2/9) * 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.7518525\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n8.  Suppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures. First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20% on the training data and 30% on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. $K = 1$) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations? Why?\n\n> Logistic regression will perform better because it has a lower test error rate. For $K = 1$, the training error rate is always zero because the closest point is always the training point itself, so the model will never make a mistake on the training set. Given that the average error rate for 1-NN is 18%, this implies a test error rate of 36%. Logistic regression, with a test error rate of 30%, is therefore the better choice.\n\n9.
