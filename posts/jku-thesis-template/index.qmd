# Background

This template is based on the [Masters/Doctoral Thesis, LaTeX Template, Version 2.5 (27 Aug 2017)](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/masters-doctoral-thesis), which [Eli Holmes](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis) updated for Quarto. I further modified the Quarto template to fulfill JKU's criteria for diploma theses and doctoral dissertations. Using Quarto was motivated by the difficulties I had when writing my first bachelor thesis in Microsoft Word. The main difficulties were ensuring consistent citation formatting, text alignment, and maintaining a tidy version-controlled workflow. Quarto effectively addresses these challenges. Above all, it combines data analysis and documentation into one platform thereby improving reproducibility.

# Installing the Template

The GitHub repository for the Quarto thesis template can be found [here](https://github.com/jallow-code/jku-quarto-thesis). Follow these steps to install and use the template:

## 1. Clone the Template

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your thesis files. Run the following command in a terminal to download the template and its associated folders:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
quarto use template jallow-code/jku-quarto-thesis

```

You will be prompted to specify an empty directory name for the template files. Provide a name for the new directory, which will store your thesis files.

## 2. Render the Template

Once the template is installed, change into the new directory:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
cd <new-directory-name>

```

To generate the document, use the command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
quarto render

```

### Troubleshooting Errors

If you encounter the following error during rendering:

``` vbnet

ERROR: 
compilation failed - missing packages (automatic install disabled)
LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...
l.872 \end{CSLReferences}
```

This error is likely due to outdated versions of Quarto or TinyTeX. To resolve it:

-   Update your [TinyTex installation](https://yihui.org/tinytex/).

-   Ensure you are using the latest version of Quarto.

# Using the Template with an Existing Document

To use this template with an existing Quarto project, make sure you have all the required LaTeX folders as described above. Then, run:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
quarto install extension jallow-code/jku-quarto-thesis
```

# Basic Usage and Customization

## Thesis Type and Frontmatter

The template is configured for a Bachelor’s thesis by default. To change this, edit the `_quarto.yml` file. For example:

``` yaml

thesis:
  type: Bachelor Thesis # Or "Master Thesis", "Doctoral Dissertation", etc.
  degree-name: Bachelor of Science
  group: Biological Chemistry # name of your study program
  supervisor:
    primary: "Assoz. Univ.-Prof. Dr. Ian Teasdale"
    co: "Dipl.-Ing. Michael Kneidinger"
  university: Johannes Kepler Universität Linz
  department: Institute of Polymer Chemistry
  faculty: Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences
```

You can also customize elements of the front matter (e.g., acknowledgments, dedication) by commenting out or modifying the respective sections in`_quarto.yml`. For instance, to exclude the dedication page:

``` yaml

# dedication: "Frontmatter/dedication.tex"
```

## Adding Symbols or Abbreviations

The `Frontmatter` folder contains LaTeX files for abbreviations, symbols, and other sections. If needed, search online for LaTeX code examples to add symbols or format abbreviations.

# Citation Styling

The default citation style is `nature-chemistry.csl`. If you prefer another style, download it from the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles?fields=chemistry) and update the `_quarto.yml` file:

``` yml

bibliography: [example.bib]
csl: your-preferred-style.csl
```
